# Problem 1

## Load the penguins data set

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## A brief description of the penguins data set

The penguin dataset contains 8 columns and 344 rows. The data contains
three different penguine species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap) from three
different islands (Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream). All data points were
collected in years 2007, 2008, 2009. 165 of the included penguins are
female, while 168 are male. The range of bill length in mm is \[32.1,
59.6\] with a mean of 43.92 and a median of 44.45. The range of bill
depth in mm is \[13.1, 21.5\] with a mean of 17.15 and a median of 17.3.
The range of body mass in grams is \[2700, 6300\] with a mean of 4201.75
and a median of 4050. The range of flipper length in mm is \[172, 231\]
with a mean of 200.92 and a median of 197. Missing values in each
variable were ignored for all above calculations.

## A piece of visualization

Below is a scatterplot of flipper length vs. bill length, colored by
species:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("bill length (mm)") + ylab("flipper length (mm)") +
  ggtitle("flipper length vs. bill length by species")
```

We save the diagram as a pdf file in this working directory:

``` r
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_scatter_plot.pdf", height=4, width=5)
```

# Problem 2

## Create a data frame according to the specification

``` r
q2_df = tibble(
  numeric_vec = rnorm(10), # a random sample of size 10 from the standard normal distribution
  logical_vec = numeric_vec > 0, # a logical vector indicating whether each sample element from above is > 0
  char_vec = c("rainy", "rainy", "snowy", "sunny", "cloudy", 
               "stormy", "foggy", "sunny", "drizzling", "windy"), # a character vector of length 10
  factor_vec = factor(c("sad", "sad", "sad", "happy", "neutral",
                        "sad", "neutral", "happy", "neutral", "neutral")) # a factor vector with 3 different levels
)

q2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    numeric_vec logical_vec char_vec  factor_vec
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1     0.185   TRUE        rainy     sad       
    ##  2    -0.358   FALSE       rainy     sad       
    ##  3     1.75    TRUE        snowy     sad       
    ##  4     1.44    TRUE        sunny     happy     
    ##  5     0.787   TRUE        cloudy    neutral   
    ##  6     0.00909 TRUE        stormy    sad       
    ##  7     0.895   TRUE        foggy     neutral   
    ##  8     1.35    TRUE        sunny     happy     
    ##  9     0.788   TRUE        drizzling neutral   
    ## 10     1.01    TRUE        windy     neutral

## Explore how the mean function behaves on different data types

The mean of the numerical vector and the logical vecctor can be computed
successfully, which equal to 0.7854672 and 0.9, respectively. However, R
raises warnings when attempting to take the mean of the character vector
and the factor vector and returns NAs:

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, var=3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, var = 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, var=-1))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, var = -1)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## Explore how numercal coercions behave on different data types

Codes below shoe attempts to apply the as.numeric() function to the
logical, character, and factor variables;

``` r
as.numeric(q2_df$logical_vec)
as.numeric(q2_df$char_vec)
as.numeric(q2_df$factor_vec)
```

The as.numeric function turns the FALSE to 0 and TRUE to 1 in the
logical vector. Therefore, R is able to successfully calculate its mean.
The as.numeric function is not able to coerce character strings to
numerical values. Therefore, it returns NAs. As a result, R turns NA
when trying to calculate the mean of a character vector. As for the
factor vector, the as.numeric function coerces the factor levels to
positive integers by alphabetical order. However, elements in the factor
elements themselves are neither logical or numeric values. Therefore, R
cannot calculate its mean and return NA as shown in the previous
subsection. However, after coercing the factor vector to a numerical
vector, its mean can be computed as 2.2 as in the code above.
